# External-format benchmark

The [`../`](../) eval seeds a whole fixture repo and runs a full winnow. This benchmark is the
other axis: **per-pair** code-vs-doc consistency, in the schema the research literature uses, so
evergreen's numbers sit next to published baselines.

## The datasets

**CASCADE** ([github.com/TobiasKiecker/CASCADE](https://github.com/TobiasKiecker/CASCADE), MIT)
is released and is the real test: 885 wild Java method/Javadoc pairs (70 inconsistent /
815 consistent), labels validated by developers' own Javadoc-fix commits. Convert and run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TobiasKiecker/CASCADE
unzip CASCADE/PaperEvaluation/dataset.zip -d cascade_dataset
python3 eval/bench/cascade_to_jsonl.py cascade_dataset > cascade.jsonl
EVAL_CONCURRENCY=8 python3 eval/bench/run_bench.py --dataset cascade.jsonl
```

**CoDocBench** ([github.com/kunpai/codocbench](https://github.com/kunpai/codocbench),
arXiv:2502.00519) supplies the wild *Python* set — 4,573 coupled code+docstring changes with no
drift labels, from which we derive candidates ((old doc, new code) = the doc that lagged;
(new doc, new code) = control) and then **validate every label with a three-LLM majority vote**
before scoring, reporting inter-annotator kappa:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kunpai/codocbench
python3 eval/bench/codocbench_to_jsonl.py codocbench/dataset/codocbench.jsonl \
    --pos 40 --neg 360 --seed 0 > derived.jsonl
EVAL_CONCURRENCY=6 python3 eval/bench/validate_labels.py derived.jsonl --out validated.jsonl
EVAL_CONCURRENCY=8 python3 eval/bench/run_bench.py --dataset validated.jsonl
```

**DocPrism's** set is still not runnable — its `anonymous.4open.science/r/DocPrism-5746`
artifact returns `{"error":"not_connected"}` — so its published precision can't be re-measured
on the same data.

`dataset.jsonl` here is **evergreen's own hand-labeled sanity fixture in their exact schema** —
14 pairs, honestly small, author-written, every label double-checked (the CCISolver paper found
45.67% of a popular benchmark's positive labels were wrong; a noisy label is worse than no
label). It proves the harness and catches regressions; it is not a comparable result.

## Protocol

Metrics are reported at a **natural 10/90 split** (headline) and a balanced 50/50 split, each as
medians over 1000 resamples of the consistent class — CASCADE's own protocol, mirrored so the
numbers line up. Rerun any committed transcript without API calls:

```sh
python3 eval/bench/run_bench.py --rescore out/bench-default.json
```

## Schema

One JSON object per line:

| field | values |
|---|---|
| `id`, `func` | identifiers |
| `code`, `doc` | the function source and its documentation |
| `label` | `consistent` \| `inconsistent` |
| `category` | `null` (consistent) \| `direct-mismatch` \| `over-promise` \| `under-promise` |

The three inconsistency categories are DocPrism's.

## The under-promise asymmetry (deliberate)

Evergreen's creed is **code is truth, the doc is the claim**: a doc that *over-promises* or
*contradicts* the code is a finding; code that quietly does *more* than the doc says
(under-promise) is informational, not drift. DocPrism labels under-promise `inconsistent`.
So on those pairs evergreen "misses" **by design** — the scorer reports them **separately**
rather than dragging down recall, and names the asymmetry instead of hiding it.

## Run

```sh
python3 eval/bench/run_bench.py            # CLI default model
EVAL_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 python3 eval/bench/run_bench.py
python3 eval/bench/run_bench.py --selftest # prove the scoring math, no API calls
```

The run prints precision/recall/F1 at both splits. Published benchmark figures were pulled
pending a re-run against the corrected judge.
